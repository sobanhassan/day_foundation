                    <p>We envision a West End of Rock Island that is a preferred place to live and thrive. This requires building the West End community's wealth, power, and livability. No single person, organization, or sector can do this independently. We all must work together to achieve it. The Martin Luther King Center is bringing together the West End community and its supporters to make overdue, positive, lasting, transformational change.</p>

                  <p>When we prevent a wrongful eviction or utility shut-off, our clients   avoid a destabilizing event that can send a family into a cycle of   financial and emotional turmoil, affecting their current and future   residential stability (Matthew Desmond, author of Evicted: Poverty and   Profit in the American City and founder of the Eviction Lab). Through   PSLS' services, we will see decreased homelessness for families due to   wrongful evictions. When we help people with disabilities and elderly   clients obtain needed medical care and medication, we reduce the need   for more expensive and complicated emergency room care, thus reducing   the number of people in economic hardship due to medical bills. When we   obtain a restraining order for a domestic violence survivor, we prevent   future exploitation, threats, violence, or even death. Each day in the   United States, three women are murdered by current or former intimate   partners. (Bureau of Justice Statistics). In addition to legal services,   PSLS offers our clients resources to help them resolve non-legal   elements of their problems thanks to our relationships with social   service agencies and local charities.</p>

Many of the students we encounter have   never visited a natural area or park like Nahant Marsh. Their visits   create moments of joy and curiosity as they walk the prairies, examine   macroinvertebrates from the docks, and enjoy activities in the education   center.</p>

                    <p>Simply put, we must Re-Establish our census to Re-Establish momentum,   long-term viability, and sustainability. Our Board has approved a   $10,000,000 Re-Establishing plan to draw new residents to Rock Island,   specifically to a section of Rock Island that has long been distressed   and neglected, including recent announcements of two for-profit   businesses pulling up their anchors. Frankly, Friendship Manor is the   largest and most valuable employer in western Rock Island. However,   drawing residents to the Manor requires us not simply to be competitive   in our service industry, but to be the best...and beyond the best.   That's why our Re-Establishing Friendship plan is crucial.</p>

This traveling exhibition highlights Mississippi’s first established collection of modern art at Tougaloo, a Historically Black College. Tougaloo has been central in the civil rights movement since its founding and gained national attention in 1963 when a group of integrated students and faculty participated in the lunch counter sit-in at Woolworth’s in downtown Jackson.  That same year, the collection’s founders began acquiring artwork to create an integrated space where art is the focus. In a fiercely segregated state, the founders believed that art could play a role in the civil rights effort. The exhibition will feature artworks by artists such as Francis Picabia, Jacob Lawrence, and Alma Thomas and will bring attention to this complex American collection established at the intersections of modern art and social justice.</p>-->
