            <h1>Funding Information</h1>
            <p>Doris and Victor Day cared about the well-being of the people of the Quad Cities, especially residents of Quad Cities, especially residents of Rock Island. They created a Foundation to provide funding for programs supportive of their concern. The Foundation is committed to meeting basic human needs such as food, shelter, clothing, medical care and education.</p>
            <p>The Directors of the Foundation are committed to a policy of flexibility, and do not want to establish regulations that limit the Foundationâ€™s creative ability to meet human needs. The Directors agree to the following points:</p>
            <p>The Foundation will make grants to organizations determined by the Internal Revenue Service to be 501 (c)(3) qualifying organizations. The Foundation is committed to serve the Quad Cities area with particular concern for the citizens of Rock Island.</p>
            <p>The Foundation recognizes that the causes of pain and suffering must be sought out, and programs developed to abolish those causes. Preventative programs and projects that foster pride in the local community will receive careful attention.</p>
          <p>The Foundation is committed to programs that are non-sectarian, and therefore, will not contribute toward programs and capital projects for religious purposes. An exemption will be made for modest contributions to the churches in which the Days held membership. However, clearly non-sectarian, community serving programs of religious organizations will be considered for funding.</p>
            <p>The Foundation is committed to community accessibility and community involvement. The Executive Director is available to consult in advance with anyone considering a grant application.</p>
          The Foundation is flexible in decision making and considers grants to be non-precedent setting. The Foundation supports operating budgets with the understanding that the Foundation should not be considered a continuing source for annual funding. Applications should state alternative sources of funding, if any, for ensuing years of the project for which they are seeking funds.
